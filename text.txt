Q1. Our sample space can be defined as an ordered list of four integers from one to six with the first
integer representing the result of the first die, the second the second die, and so on.
Let M be a random variable that represent the greatest die out of all four.
Let Di represent the result of the first die, let Da represent the result of the second die, and so
on up to Da
Let Ik be an indicator variable that equals 1 if the greatest value of the die rolls is at least k for
some integer k between 1 and 6 and one otherwise.
P(Ik = 1) = P(DIU D2 UDUDa ≥ k).
We can calculate this probability using the complement rule and DeMorgan's law.
P/DIUDUDUDa>K) =1-P(DINDaNDanDa <K)
Each die roll is clearly independent since each die roll is fair so knowing the result of one one die
will give you a clue as to the result of the other. Therefore we can calculate the probability of
the intersection by multiplying the probability of the individual die rolls together.
P(Di < k) is the probability that a given die roll is between 1 and k - 1. There are k - 1 desired
outcomes over 6 possible outcomes so P(Di < k) =
Therefore P(DUDUDsUDA≥k) =1-P/DINDanDanD<1) = 1-(k-1
E(1) = 0* P(IR = 0) + 1*P(IN = 1) = 1- k-1
Now we will find E(M).
Consider the scenario where M = j for some integer j between 1 and 6.
If M = j this means the maximum value of the dice rolls is greater than or equal to all of the
values from 1 to j including j. So Ik = 1 for all values k from one to j, and Ik = 0 for all other
values of k.
Therefore <I = j so [Ik = M since M = j.
Therefore we can use the linearity of expectation to find M
