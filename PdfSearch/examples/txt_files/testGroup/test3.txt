Q1. Our sample space can be defined as an ordered list of four integers from one to six with the first
integer representing the result of the first die, the second the second die, and so on.
Let M be a random variable that represent the greatest die out of all four.
Let Di represent the result of the first die, let Da represent the result of the second die, and so
on up to Da
Let Ik be an indicator variable that equals 1 if the greatest value of the die rolls is at least k for
some integer k between 1 and 6 and one otherwise.
P(Ik = 1) = P(DIU D2 UDUDa ≥ k).
We can calculate this probability using the complement rule and DeMorgan's law.
P/DIUDUDUDa>K) =1-P(DINDaNDanDa <K)
Each die roll is clearly independent since each die roll is fair so knowing the result of one one die
will give you a clue as to the result of the other. Therefore we can calculate the probability of
the intersection by multiplying the probability of the individual die rolls together.
P(Di < k) is the probability that a given die roll is between 1 and k - 1. There are k - 1 desired
outcomes over 6 possible outcomes so P(Di < k) =
Therefore P(DUDUDsUDA≥k) =1-P/DINDanDanD<1) = 1-(k-1
E(1) = 0* P(IR = 0) + 1*P(IN = 1) = 1- k-1
Now we will find E(M).
Consider the scenario where M = j for some integer j between 1 and 6.
If M = j this means the maximum value of the dice rolls is greater than or equal to all of the
values from 1 to j including j. So Ik = 1 for all values k from one to j, and Ik = 0 for all other
values of k.
Therefore <I = j so [Ik = M since M = j.
Therefore we can use the linearity of expectation to find M
Q2. The sample space for this question would be all integers from 10 to 199999 that could be made
by this process.
D be a random variable that reprsents the number of digits in the number
Let Ik be a random variable that equals 1 if the kth position has a digit and 0 otherwise. k
ranges from 1 to 6. For example for the number 134 I1 to I would equal 1 and I to I6 would
equal 0.
Next we will find P (Ik = 1)
For k = 1 and k = 2 this is equal to 1 since the first digit is always one and a second digit is
always chosen.
For 3 ≥ k ≥ 6 P(Ik = 1) is the probability that every digit before position k is odd.
The first digit is always odd since it is one.
For digits 2 to k - 1, since every digit is randomly chosen and there are an equal number of even
and odd digits, the probability the digit is odd is
There are k - 1 - 2 + 1 = k - 2 digits between k - 1 and 2 inclusive. Since each digit is
independently chosen the probability all digits before k are odd is 2k-2 which is the same as
P (IK = 1).
E(Ik) = 0* P(Ik= 0) + 1* P(Ik=1) = 1 if k = 1,2 and 2k-2 if k = 3,4,5,6
D=LIk since that gives the total number of digits.
By the linearity of expectation E(D) = S E(Ik) = 1+1+51
324-2=2+51
